**GRASPS Model** 

Goals -
The Goal of this report is to critically evaluate the case study "Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the Industry: 
Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web Services Academy." A summary of the key points from the case study will be evaluated, 
analyzed as relevant to higher education and employability, and synthesized insights drawn out to note gaps or opportunities 
for further research.

Roles -
As a researcher, my role is to critically analyze the literature, discuss its implications for curriculum design and student
 employability, and recommend future initiatives that are in line with industry requirements.

Audience -
This report is prepared for academic instructors or stakeholders in higher education who are interested in improving
 curriculum design to enhance graduate employability.

Situation -
The context of this report is the increasing demand that higher education institutions justify tuition costs by 
providing students with practical skills and employment opportunities. This report discovers how the integration of
 AWS Academy into a cloud computing module addresses this issue.

Products/Performance
This detailed report highlights the key points of the case study, then critically analyzes collaboration 
strengths and weaknesses, synthesizes relevance to higher education employability, and concludes. 


****Detailed Report****

Introduction
The high cost of higher education has made it increasingly imperative for better value,
 with students and parents demanding that institutions offer employability-focused curricula. 
 This report looks at a case study in which AWS Academy resources were incorporated into a module 
 on cloud computing to enhance students' theoretical and practical skills.

Summary of Key Findings

The curriculum redesign included AWS Academy Cloud Foundations material, including industry-standard hands-on labs, videos, and white papers.
Students were exposed to industry best practices and practical skills in cloud computing and the Internet of Things.
The collaboration with AWS experts gave students an insight into career pathways and internship opportunities.


Critical Analysis
The collaboration with AWS Academy is a significant step toward aligning educational outcomes with industry needs
. The case study highlights several strengths, including:
Improved student engagement through hands-on labs.
Alignment of curriculum with industry certification (e.g., AWS Cloud Practitioner)
Practical engagement with industry tools and practices.


However, its possible weaknesses are:
Reliance on the industry partner will pose sustainability concerns
Generalisability of results will be narrow since the case study is taken on a single institution and domain of study.


Integration and Synthesis
Such initiatives integrate theoretical concepts within practical application domains and therefore exhibit significant value addition.
 Expanding such partnerships through collaboration with similar industry leaders may further broaden this model. Its application towards 
 other disciplines could further provide for benefits such as in data analytics or cybersecurity fields.


Conclusion
It may serve as a benchmark to improve the employability-focused curriculum. Institutions of higher education can better prepare 
students for entry into the workforce and also meet the demands for value in education by combining theoretical knowledge with practical 
industry experience. Subsequent initiatives should, therefore, consider diversifying industry partnerships and measuring outcomes over the 
longer term to ensure long-term sustainability and applicability.
