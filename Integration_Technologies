Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the
Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web
Services Academy



**GRASPS Model** 

Goal
To design and implement an industry-standard cloud computing curriculum that equips students with relevant skills, combining the theoretical
 knowledge with practical skills. The idea is to bring employability by getting the academic content aligned with cutting-edge cloud technologies
 provided by AWS Academy, keeping the students job-ready for the dynamic IT industry.

Role
The students are cloud computing trainees performing tasks that reflect the real world. They act as problem solvers,
 using AWS tools to design scalable systems, manage virtualized environments, and analyze big data, which is a 
professional expectation in the industry.

Audience -
The curriculum outcomes are directed at cloud computing employers, academic stakeholders, and technology providers like AWS. 
The outputs of the students show readiness for the workforce, which has been identified by the industry as a gap in skills.

Situation -
Students are placed in realistic learning environments where they use AWS Academy's labs and materials to address technical 
and business challenges. These include solving issues in scalability, distributed systems, and cloud security, simulating industry tasks.

Products/Performance -
In it, students deliver the prototypes, reports on analysis, and system simulation using AWS Academy tools. They will also be assessed for
 industry-aligned certifications, and therefore, well prepared for entering particular job categories, such as cloud architects or DevOps engineers.

****Detailed Report****

Introduction
The high cost of higher education has made it increasingly imperative for better value,
 with students and parents demanding that institutions offer employability-focused curricula. 
 This report looks at a case study in which AWS Academy resources were incorporated into a module 
 on cloud computing to enhance students' theoretical and practical skills.

Summary of Key Findings

The curriculum redesign included AWS Academy Cloud Foundations material, including industry-standard hands-on labs, videos, and white papers.
Students were exposed to industry best practices and practical skills in cloud computing and the Internet of Things.
The collaboration with AWS experts gave students an insight into career pathways and internship opportunities.


Critical Analysis
The collaboration with AWS Academy is a significant step toward aligning educational outcomes with industry needs
. The case study highlights several strengths, including:
Improved student engagement through hands-on labs.
Alignment of curriculum with industry certification (e.g., AWS Cloud Practitioner)
Practical engagement with industry tools and practices.


However, its possible weaknesses are:
Reliance on the industry partner will pose sustainability concerns
Generalisability of results will be narrow since the case study is taken on a single institution and domain of study.


Integration and Synthesis
Such initiatives integrate theoretical concepts within practical application domains and therefore exhibit significant value addition.
 Expanding such partnerships through collaboration with similar industry leaders may further broaden this model. Its application towards 
 other disciplines could further provide for benefits such as in data analytics or cybersecurity fields.


Conclusion
It may serve as a benchmark to improve the employability-focused curriculum. Institutions of higher education can better prepare 
students for entry into the workforce and also meet the demands for value in education by combining theoretical knowledge with practical 
industry experience. Subsequent initiatives should, therefore, consider diversifying industry partnerships and measuring outcomes over the 
longer term to ensure long-term sustainability and applicability.
